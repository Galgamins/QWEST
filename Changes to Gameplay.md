# Noteworthy Mods and what gameplay to expect.

Qwest has two profiles of your choosing, with default profile utilizing the [EnaiRim suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) of mods, or the [Simonrim Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746), if you choose the Simonrim profile, to provide the bulk of the perk/player character changes. 

## Survival
If you chose to not make any modifications and go with the survival mods, you will have way more micromanagement to do.

1. You will need to eat and sleep to survive. 
2. You will need to survive the cold or your stamina will drain and you'll die. 
3. You will need to clean yourself or you'll have very bad prices and everyone will smell you when trying to sneak.

You should definitely check the Skill Trees within your campfire on top of the vanilla skill trees. Your arrows will have weight and you will need to sleep to level up your Character. If you're unfamiliar with the survival mods, have a read of [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), [Dirt and Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40746) and [SunHelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414).

Lastly, all profiles have way better horse management thanks to [Convenient Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9519)!

## Added Quests

[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) forms the core spine of the list. QWEST! is the list with the most addons for it, but many new lands aren't integrated with the museum. These include [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789), [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423), and [Hammet's Dungeon Packs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186) - all of which you can find in QWEST!

## Overhauled Quests
From [Finding Derkeethus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19550) to [Save the Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) with [Thieves' Guild Night On the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069) or [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26788), many quests have been changed and expanded.

You should know that the [Thieves Guild have Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) now, and you can [Renounce the Daedra if you will](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36100), while [Vampires can skip Fort Dawnguard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25783).

## Followers
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) will provide a nice amount of high quality followers but there is still the unforgettable [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035), [Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) ([with her cute face overhaul!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29345)), [Kaidan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1907), [Skeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47558), [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164), and even [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137). There is also [Serana Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16222) to give Serana extra dialogue!

## Loot, Artefacts and Leveling 
[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612) overhauls all vanilla Artifacts and [Dynamic Dungeon Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10308) - coupled with [Lock Related Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11342) - makes sure you do not find spider webs in the dungeon chests. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes leveling so that exploring the world of Skyrim increases your character level, with individual skill levels increasing independently. There is a skill cap to avoid powerleveling which is determined by the player character level. More details on this can be seen on the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), which I recommend you read.

## Enemies and General Difficulty 
QWEST! isn't here to make the game feel like it has a sort of "Dark Souls" difficulty. My philosophy on enemies is that diversity is more important than difficulty, and that diversity is going to naturally make the game more challenging. That is why you will find all kinds of bandits, draugrs, vampires, and dragons, while they all have new cool spells due to [EEOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37228).

A wide variety of mods are used to increase variety to the enemies you encounter across Tamriel. Draugrs have been diversified using [DUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775), [BriDO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Cannibal Draugr on Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21238). Bandit types have been implemented via [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) and its Patrol addon. Vampires have been improved through the use of [Better Vampire NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510). Dragons are enhanced using [Splendor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670), [Diverse Dragons Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Zim's Dragon Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38693). This list is not exhaustive!
