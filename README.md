# Preamble

Designed to be a "Mighty Modlist for Mini Machines", QWEST was born after a few people were talking about how some people they knew couldn't enjoy a modded Sykrim due to the hardware requirements. The list has a graphical suite that improves the visuals whilst also being friendly to users with 2GB of VRAM. If you can run vanilla Skyrim, you should be able to run this. In QWEST, you will find major mods such as Legacy of the Dragonborn, Interesting NPC's, Wyrmstooth, new armors and weapons, new music and reworked weathers and lighting. There are many more changes which are detailed in the changes to gameplay file.

The list was originally created by Sovn and was passed to myself and my team after Sovn wished to stop working on the list. If you have any queries regarding the list, please ask them in the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).

The name and picture are a reference to the amazing and wholesome Quest Sprout comic available on [swordscomic.com](https://swordscomic.com). Their official Twitter is [here](https://twitter.com/swordscomic).

**Please read the ReadMe in Full. The installation process is not completed once you have finished the Wabbajack installation.**

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

#### Steam Config

##### Disable the Steam Overlay

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the _General_ tab and un-tick the _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ checkbox.

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language and Windows Region to English

This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. Some mods can break when using a non English version of Windows. Ensure that your Windows Regional Format is set to English. 

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

Due to the way Qwest is setup is setup, I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/` by deleting the contents in it. Alternatively, use the [Shredder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133) to complelety wipe the game.

### It is *vital* that your Binkw64.dll is unmodified and *not* a replacement from another mod. If you have a version that is not 292KB in size, delete it and verify your game files.

#### Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and and let it do the initial graphics check. Do not worry about this part as the installation will replace this graphics settings.
Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads, OneDrive or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

#### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

To prepare the download, and make sure Wabbajack doesn't stall on those files; download those 4 mods manually: 
- https://mega.nz/file/IS4EjJhC#inP4yfb3i-UO_sx790OpoFDk81x-WIRf9WcBeKxnmYo
- https://mega.nz/file/4LxGTALK#7I8XPLnIW0PxR_r_nXMP-9ZUnZ16MlFVMdFdgGy-gF0
- https://mega.nz/file/8T4ixLCB#YKQw5EDFdL1_e-5G_JB8WgmUkJ8N0kNtpzeOwUHZcZY
- https://mega.nz/file/EcJhgKpY#4Q86Rd1hUepjm233r8Q_7x3fTWx9axJN2CUc8FXrBsg

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists.
2. Download the modlist from the Wabbajack UI.
3. Once the download is done, set the installation folder to somewhere that is not affected by UAC (Please do not put it in Documents, Program Files, Desktop. Put it somewhere easy like `C:/Modlists/QWEST`). The downloads path should automatically fill in the installation path.
4. Go back to your drive, and create a new folder, called "Wabbajack Downloads Folder". This specific folder can be on a different drive if you wish.
5. Select the created folder in 4. as your downloads folder. Place the downloaded MEGA files above AS IS in the downloads folder.
6. Click the Go/Begin button
7. Wait for Wabbajack to finish
8. If you run into any issues see the next section. If the installation is successful, proceed to [Post-Installation](#post-installation).

##### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait until I update the Modlist.

**x is not a whitelisted download**:

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

**Windows is reporting that a virus has been detected**:

Windows 10 has started to auto quarantine the usvfs_proxy_x86.exe file from the latest version of Mod Organizer 2 saying a threat was detected. This is a known false postive confirmed by the MO2 Devs. You can fix this by adding an exemption for MO2 Folder to your Antivirus. An example for windows defender can be found [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

### Post-Installation

## Game Folder
The installation will create a copy of your Skyrim Special Edition game in Instalation Folder/Game Root. This will then contain all the necessary files such as SKSE, ENB Binaries and mod required dlls such as Engine Fixes. There is no need to copy anything to your Steam version of Skyrim as we will be running SKSE from within this folder to play the game.

### Post-Installation

## Copy Game Folder Files

When the installation is complete, copy the files in the `QWEST!\Game Folder Files` folder and paste them into your Skyrim folder (with the SkyrimSE.exe and the data folder). [HERE](http://prntscr.com/124984m).

## Graphical Settings

If you wish to change your ini settings, which is recommended if you have 2GB of vram, then navigate to BethINI which is located in `QWEST!\Tools` and run the program. Make sure that you select the correct profile you wish to play, these are show here for [EnaiRim](https://prnt.sc/10ha499) and [SimonRim](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/793809552353132566/818888086079012915/Capture.PNG). If one or the other doesn't show properly, use the browse option to manually set it up.

Listed below is some information regarding the presets in BethINI

- BethINI (Low) (locked to 60 FPS):
  - Everywhere (where it got tested): 60FPS

- BethINI (Medium) (locked to 60 FPS): 
  - Outdoors: 30-40 FPS (average 40)
  - Cities: 40-60 FPS (average 50)
  - Indoors: 60FPS

- If you have 8GB RAM and **NO SSD** or if it still has frame drops, then I recommend:
  - Testing:
    - BethINI (Medium) -> BethINI (Poor) and stopping by the preset that has a playable framerate for you.

## Pagefile in prevention of memory crashes

Bigger Skyrim modlists need a lot of memory, and when there is not enough available it may fail allocating more. To fix this, you'll want to have a bigger pagefile.
A pagefile is a file on your disk Windows will use when there is not enough RAM available.
Never disable the pagefile - this may lead to various issues on your system, such as this Skyrim crash.

If you've never touched the pagefile, perform the following steps to prevent from memory crashes:
1. Press Windows + R on your keyboard and enter `sysdm.cpl ,3`
2. Under the Performance section, press 'Settings'
3. Go to the Advanced tab at the top, and at the Virtual memory section press 'Change...'
4. Disable 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'
5. If you have more than one drive, try enabling it for at least one more drive as a backup (make sure it has a decent bit of free space, like 15GB). Set the size to 'System managed size'.
Otherwise, set a custom size for the drive it's currently on and increase the maximum size to be at least 20GB.

## Getting an ENB

Whilst this list is aimed towards lower end PCs, that does not mean that an ENB is not an option for you. If you have 2GB of vram, it is advised that you test in game first to check your performance and then come back to this section.

This list includes a custom tweaked variation of [Zangdar's Rudy Cathedral](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39113) that was specifically made for this list. To install this ENB, navigate to `Your Installation Folder\ENB Presets`([here](http://prntscr.com/10e2nl4)) and simply drag and drop the contents of either the performance one or the higher-end one ([as shown in this picture](http://prntscr.com/10e2odv) to your Skyrim SE Directory (where the game .exe is).

On 2GB Cards, the average fps is 30 with the Low End Preset and Medium Bethini Preset. This is very dependent on your PC, however, so your mileage may vary.

If you find that the ENB is too intensive for your system, you can try a ReShade preset which can offer a similar style of graphics but with much less performance cost. Here are three Reshades that are recommended for usage with QWEST!

- [BTS - Beautifully Textured Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25489)
- [Ulver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40433)
- [Lucid-Icrous Lightweight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45771)

To install a reshade follow these instructions:

- Download the latest ReShade Version from [here](https://reshade.me/)
- Open ReShade.exe, Select SkyrimSE.exe as the game you want to install it to. 
- Select Direct3D 10/11/12 as the rendering API
- Check/Tick every single box until ReShade is installed.
Now we'll go back to the presets downloaded
- Open the ReShade Preset archive and paste it to your game folder.
- When Skyrim launches (Refer to the next step in the readme if lost on this step), press the home button on your keyboard and select the .ini file you just put in your Skyrim Folder as the loaded .ini
- Press home again to close the window.
Know that you can switch any ini at anytime during your gameplay, so if you want to compare between the 2 that I recommend, you can totally do that in game.

## Personalisation

`tbc`

## How to start up QWEST!

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once it's launched, there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to SKSE by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

Upon pressing New Game, you will spawn on the walls of Helgen burning down. Once all the messages on the top left corner of the screen are gone, set the MCMs as instructed below.

If you press enter, you will be teleported to a location where you will be able to personalize your character.
After confirming your character, never use showracemenu to change its race or sex; you will then be able to start the game. If you want to customize the MCMs or need some more time to setup Skyrim Unbound, you can use the "Stay there" option.

Do NOT Select a NON DRAGONBORN OPTION within Skyrim Unbound! Doing so will result in broken questlines! You cannot escape your destiny!

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, please check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## In-Game MCM Options

`tbc`

## How to start playing

After you finish customizing all the MCMs, the last thing to check is the Skyrim Unbound MCM. You can safely experiment with all the options in there, EXCEPT choosing a Non-Dragonborn character.
Anything else in that menu can be customized to your liking. When you're ready, simply press the Start Adventure button in the Unbound MCM. You will then be prompted to create your character as usual.

Please Note: Do NOT change sex or race with showracemenu after first confirming your character.

## FAQ

## FAQ

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Ultrawide Options

Although I do not see why someone would have such a screen with the targeted minimals of the list, here's a document made by Mantis to help you solve such problems. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3Yapmu_IkTWSszJ4h9wpNxgNLCi46f7XiJknpdMb6E/edit?usp=sharing)

## I have a question/ I found a bug

Please report it in the support channel or in the relevant channel in the community server.

## A face part is crashing me! | Some hair/facial hair clips!

The face part is due to High Poly Head and is currently unfixable. The latter is a known issue and is currently being worked on.

## I can't talk to NPCs!

Headwear that conceals your identity will stop NPCs from interacting with you, for more details check [Sneak Tools' Modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1863).

## First Person animations are weird, how do I fix??

1st person animations are overhauled by [First Person Combat Animations Overhaul 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177). You can safely disable this in the MO2 left pane should you wish to.

## What perk does the new weapons use?
- Rapiers get Sword perks
- Pikes get great sword perks
- Halberds get two handed axe perks
- Quarter Staffs get War Hammer perks
- Claws get dagger perks
- Whips get mace perks

## My character T-Poses!

Cap your framerate, either with BethINI, SSE Display Tweaks, or ENB.

## My Legacy of the Dragonborn (LOTD) Quests are not starting up even though I have the number of Relics the Wiki says I need.
The mod [Quest and Reward Delay for LOTD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44923) changes the requirements for the quests. Please use their new chart to see the requirements for starting the quests

## The game is a bit too dark/I want to change some ENB settings.

Firstly, please calibrate your monitor to ensure your settings are correct. Most monitors are not properly calibrated when they ship from the factory, so it is advised to calibrate them.

[Quick Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12633) is also included to facilitate making the game brighter. You can adjust the brightness of this in the MCM menu.

Should you wish to change the ENB follow this:

- When in game, press Shift+Enter to open ENB Menu. In the right tab, called Shader Parameters at the top, select 'ENBEFFECT.FX' You will see different options for every time of day and night, and a separate slider for Interior Brightness. Dont forget to save configuration all the way in the top left.  

## How do I start the main quest?

In order to start the main quest, you need to either hit the level you specified or the daytime specified in the Skyrim unbound MCM menu (this defaults to 7-21 days). Instead of doing the first few quests, you will be summoned by the Greybeards after killing the dragon.

The way of becoming a thane of Whiterun is also changed. Complete The Blessings of Nature quest and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired/the sappling blooms. He'll thank you and allow you to buy the Breezehome, and the standard thaneship quest (help people of the hold and buy a house to become a thane) will be avialable.

## Creation Club (CC Content) Support?

Not supported.

## I want to support your work!

I would advise you to donate to [Wabbajack](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=11907933) first, but if you wish to support me you can do so [here](https://www.patreon.com/Althro).
